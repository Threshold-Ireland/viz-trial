<h1>For Hackathon Judges</h1>
<h3>Summary of results</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wrote code, including using Azure Cognitive Services, to translate PDFs to CSVs, retrieve CSVs from government data services, do data cleaning,
etc.
<li>Developed a model for the cost of homelessness in Ireland, involving figuring out a model accounting for direct and indirect expenditure. Expose
those assumptions on the main dashboard.
<li>From that data and that model, build auto-updating dashboards (on main linked page) where we were confident of the strength of the correlations
we'd found (and had time to finish them).
<li>Found a series of equations to describe other relationships (some illustrated below).
<li>Helped the charity partner start their data fluency / digital transformation process, and gave them really useful ways to talk numbers to
organizations that only talk numbers, rather than personal experiences.
<li>Did a series of data explorations in Jupyter, helpful for advocacy purposes for the charity partner [Threshold](http://www.threshold.ie), and could
be turned into auto-updating dashboards later with more time.
<ol>
<li>We noticed a strong relationship between unit availability and rent price if you shift rent price by 18 months - could be a lag reaction
of pricing to how many units are on the market at a given time. There's an equation to the curve, which we found, so we can potentially say
something like "if we added 100 additional available rental units to the market, in 18 months we can expect average rental prices to drop by X".
, which [from the previous linear relationship between rent price and homeless #] would mean N fewer homeless adults"
<p>
That equation is:
```wo inputs:
x1 = current availability, x2 = desired availability
 
will increase/decrease rent by: exp(12.076 * (0.945 ** (1.1532 * log(x1)))) - exp(12.076 * (0.945 ** (1.1532 * log(x2))))

will increase/decrease homeless population by: abs(exp(12.076 * (0.945 ** (1.1532 * log(x1)))) - exp(12.076 * (0.945 ** (1.1532 * log(x2))))) * 2.983```
The relationship is exponential, so the more availability when there's low availability to begin with (<3K units),
the more drastic the effect will be on rent price.
